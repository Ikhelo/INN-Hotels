# Context
Booking cancellations are the bane of hotel businesses. Many hotels have to grapple with customers canceling bookings for a number of reasons such as change in plans, getting better deals from the competition, indecisiveness of potential customers etc. Usually, the business model for the hotel industry allows customers to easily make bookings and cancel bookings. However, these cancellations affect the industry even though it is benefical to potential customers and guests. Depending on the season, most hotels usually allow guests to cancel free of charge or at a low cost even at last minute. One major disadvantage is that hoteliers make plans and preparation for guests from bookings and incur costs based on these preparations which may still be canceled at last minute and at no charge to the guests.

New technologies in the hotel business has brought improvement, for example, ease of bookings, real-time communication with guests, management softwares, payment processing etc. However, these gifts to the customers has also posed some challenges to the hoteliers. The ease of bookings and improved search engine optimisations mean that customers can easily shop, find new deals, cancel prior bookings and make new reservations.

Hotel booking cancellations affect hotels in various ways:

Marketing and distribution costs. Commissions are paid by hotels to 3rd-party distribution channels upon booking confirmation and not refunded if bookings get canceled.
Hotels lose money when reserved rooms cannot be be resold after last minute booking cancellations.
Reduction in profit margins when hotels have to drop prices last minute to incentivise potential customers.
Human resources to make arrangements for the guests.
